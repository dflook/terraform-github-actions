      Variables set here override any given in `var_file`s.

outputs:
  failure-reason:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure`, this output may be set. The value may be one of:

      - `destroy-failed` - The Terraform destroy operation failed.
      - `state-locked` - The Terraform state lock could not be obtained because it was already locked.

      If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
      This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run a steps.
  lock-info:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure` and the failure-reason is `state-locked`, this output will be set.

      It is a json object containing any available state lock information and typically has the form:

      ```json
      {
        "ID": "838fbfde-c5cd-297f-84a4-d7578b4a4880",
