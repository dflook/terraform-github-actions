This is one of a suite of terraform related actions - find them at [dflook/terraform-github-actions](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions).

This action uses the `terraform validate` command to check that a terraform configuration is valid.
This can be used to check that a configuration is valid before creating a plan.

Failing GitHub checks will be added for any problems found.
