inputs:
  path:
    description: The path to the OpenTofu root module directory.
    required: false
    default: "."
  workspace:
    description: The name of the OpenTofu workspace to destroy and delete.
    required: true
  variables:
    description: |
      Variables to set for the tofu destroy. This should be valid OpenTofu syntax - like a [variable definition file](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/values/variables/#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).

      Variables set here override any given in `var_file`s.
    required: false
  var_file:
    description: |
      List of tfvars files to use, one per line.
      Paths should be relative to the GitHub Actions workspace
    required: false
  var:
    description: |
      Comma separated list of OpenTofu vars to set.
      This is deprecated due to the following limitations:
      - Only primitive types can be set with `var` - number, bool and string.
      - String values may not contain a comma.
      - Values set with `var` will be overridden by values contained in `var_file`s
      - Does not work with the `remote` backend
      You can change from `var` to `variables` by putting each variable on a separate line and ensuring each string value is quoted.
    required: false
    deprecationMessage: Use the variables input instead.
  backend_config:
    description: List of OpenTofu backend config values, one per line.
    required: false

    required: false
    default: "0"

outputs:
  failure-reason:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure`, this output may be set. The value may be one of:

      - `destroy-failed` - The OpenTofu destroy operation failed.
      - `state-locked` - The OpenTofu state lock could not be obtained because it was already locked. 

      If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
      This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run a steps.
  lock-info:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure` and the failure-reason is `state-locked`, this output will be set.

      It is a json object containing any available state lock information and typically has the form:
      ```json
      {
        "ID": "838fbfde-c5cd-297f-84a4-d7578b4a4880",
