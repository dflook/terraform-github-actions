# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The actions are versioned as a suite. Some actions may have no change in behaviour between versions.

When using an action you can specify the version as:

- `@v1.19.0` to use an exact release
- `@v1.19` to use the latest patch release for the specific minor version
- `@v1` to use the latest patch release for the specific major version


## [1.19.0] - 2021-11-01

### Changed
- When triggered by `issue_comment` or `pull_request_review_comment` events, the action will first add a :+1: reaction to the comment
- PR comment status messages include a single emoji that shows progress at a glance
- Actions that don't write to the terraform state no longer lock it.

## [1.18.0] - 2021-10-30

### Added
- A new `replace` input for [dflook/terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan#inputs) and [dflook/terraform-apply](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-apply#inputs)

  This instructs terraform to replace the specified resources, and is available with terraform versions that support replace (v0.15.2 onwards).

  ```yaml
  with:
    replace: |
      random_password.database
  ```

- A `target` input for [dflook/terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan#inputs) to match [dflook/terraform-apply](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-apply#inputs)

  `target` limits the plan to the specified resources and their dependencies. This change removes the restriction that `target` can only be used with `auto_approve`.

  ```yaml
  with:
    target: |
      kubernetes_secret.tls_cert_public
      kubernetes_secret.tls_cert_private
  ```

## [1.17.2] - 2021-10-13

### Fixed
- Add `terraform plan` output that was missing from the workflow log

## [1.17.1] - 2021-10-06

### Fixed
- Fix ownership of files created in runner mounted directories

  As the container is run as root, it can cause issues when root owned files are leftover that the runner can't cleanup.
  This would only affect self-hosted, non-ephemeral, non-root runners.

## [1.17.0] - 2021-10-04

### Added
- `variables` and `var_file` support for remote operations in Terraform Cloud/Enterprise.

  The Terraform CLI & Terraform Cloud/Enterprise do not support using variables or variable files with remote plans or applies.
  We can do better. `variables` and `var_file` input variables for the plan, apply & check actions now work, with the expected behavior.

## [1.16.0] - 2021-10-04

### Added
- [dflook/terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan) has gained two new outputs:
  - `json_plan_path` is a path to the generated plan in a JSON format file
  - `text_plan_path` is a path to the generated plan in a human readable text file

  These paths are relative to the GitHub Actions workspace and can be read by other steps in the same job.

## [1.15.0] - 2021-09-20

### Added
- Actions that intentionally cause a build failure now set a `failure-reason` output to enable safely responding to those failures.

  Possible failure reasons are:
  - [dflook/terraform-validate](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-validate#outputs): validate-failed
  - [dflook/terraform-fmt-check](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-fmt-check#outputs): check-failed
  - [dflook/terraform-check](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-check#outputs): changes-to-apply
  - [dflook/terraform-apply](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-apply#outputs): apply-failed, plan-changed
  - [dflook/terraform-destroy](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-destroy#outputs): destroy-failed
  - [dflook/terraform-destroy-workspace](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-destroy-workspace#outputs): destroy-failed

### Fixed
- [dflook/terraform-validate](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-validate) was sometimes unable to create detailed check failures.

## [1.14.0] - 2021-09-15

### Added
- Support for self-hosted GitHub Enterprise deployments. Thanks [f0rkz](https://github.com/f0rkz)!

### Changed
- The `path` input variable is now optional, defaulting to the Action workspace.
- Uninteresting workflow log output is now grouped and collapsed by default.

### Fixed
- Applying PR approved plans where the plan comment is not within the first 30 comments.

## [1.13.0] - 2021-07-24

### Added
- `TERRAFORM_PRE_RUN` environment variable for customising the environment before running terraform.

  It can be set to a command that will be run prior to `terraform init`.

  The runtime environment for these actions is subject to change in minor version releases.
  If using this environment variable, specify the minor version of the action to use.

  The runtime image is currently based on `debian:buster`, with the command run using `bash -xeo pipefail`.

  For example:
  ```yaml
  env:
    TERRAFORM_PRE_RUN: |
      # Install latest Azure CLI
      curl -skL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash

      # Install postgres client
      apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client
  ```
  
  Thanks to [alec-pinson](https://github.com/alec-pinson) and [GiuseppeChiesa-TomTom](https://github.com/GiuseppeChiesa-TomTom) for working on this feature.

## [1.12.0] - 2021-06-08

### Changed
- [terraform-fmt-check](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-fmt-check) now shows a diff in the workflow log when it finds files in non-canonical format

## [1.11.0] - 2021-06-05

### Added
- The `add_github_comment` input for [terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan) may now be set to `changes-only`. This will only add a PR comment
  for plans that result in changes to apply - no comment will be added for plans with no changes.

### Changed
- Improved messaging in the workflow log when [terraform-apply](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-apply) is aborted because the plan has changed
- Update documentation for `backend_config`, `backend_config_file`, `var_file` & `target` inputs to use separate lines for multiple values. 
  Multiple values may still be separated by commas if preferred.

## [1.10.0] - 2021-05-30

### Added
- `TERRAFORM_HTTP_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for configuring the username and password to use for
  `git::https://` & `https://` module sources.

  See action documentation for details, e.g. [terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan#environment-variables)

## [1.9.3] - 2021-05-29

### Fixed
- With terraform 0.15.4, terraform-plan jobs that only had changes to outputs would fail when creating a PR comment.

## [1.9.2] - 2021-05-05

### Fixed
- Slow state locking messages were being considered part of the plan, which could cause apply actions to be aborted.

## [1.9.1] - 2021-04-21

### Fixed
- Terraform 0.15 plans were not being extracted correctly, causing failures to apply.

## [1.9.0] - 2021-04-10

### Added
- `variables` input for actions that use terraform input variables.

  This value should be valid terraform syntax - like a [variable definition file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).
  Variable values set in `variables` override any given in var_files.
  See action documentation for details, e.g. [terraform-plan](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-plan#inputs).

### Deprecated
- The `var` input has been deprecated due to the following limitations:
  - Only primitive types can be set with `var` - number, bool and string.
  - String values may not contain a comma.
  - Values set with `var` will be overridden by values contained in `var_file`s

  `variables` is the preferred way to set input variables.

## [1.8.0] - 2021-04-05

### Added
- `TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKENS` environment variable for use with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise etc
  when using module registries or a `remote` backend.

- `TERRAFORM_SSH_KEY` environment variable to configure an SSH private key to use for
  [Git Repository](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/sources.html#generic-git-repository) module sources.

See individual actions for details, e.g. [terraform-validate](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions/tree/master/terraform-validate#environment-variables).

## [1.7.0] - 2021-04-02

### Added
- Support for the [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event
- Support for the [`pull_request_review`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_review) event

### Fixed
- Terraform 0.15 compatibility

## [1.6.0] - 2021-02-25

### Added
- PR comments use a one line summary of the terraform output, with the full output in a collapsable pane.

  If a plan is short the output is shown by default. This can be controlled with the `TF_PLAN_COLLAPSE_LENGTH` environment
  variable for the [dflook/terraform-plan](terraform-plan) action.

### Fixed
- Now makes far fewer github api requests to avoid rate limiting.

## [1.5.2] - 2021-01-16

### Fixed
- Multiple steps in the same job now only download the terraform binary once.

## [1.5.1] - 2020-12-05

### Fixed
- PR comments had an empty plan with Terraform 0.14

## [1.5.0] - 2020-09-18

### Added
- PR comments use HCL highlighting

## [1.4.2] - 2020-09-02

### Fixed
- Using a personal access token instead of the Actions provided token now works.
  This can be used to customise the PR comment author

## [1.4.1] - 2020-08-11

### Fixed
- Latest Terraform versions with a patch version of '0' are correctly detected.
  If not otherwise specified the latest terraform version is used. As of now the latest is v0.13.0.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-07-25

### Added
- Better support for the `issue_comment` and `pull_request_review_comment`
  events in the [dflook/terraform-plan](terraform-plan) and [dflook/terraform-apply](terraform-apply) actions

  This allows using plan PR comments when triggered in reponse to those
  events, enabling workflows like [applying a plan using a comment](terraform-apply#applying-a-plan-using-a-comment).

### Fixed
- Plan errors are now correctly added to the workflow log.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-07-23

### Fixed
- `backend_config_file` and `var_file` now work correctly. Paths should
  be relative to the Action workspace.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-07-22

### Added
- Support for the `remote` backend.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-07-18

### Added
- Complex terraform types are now available as action outputs, which results in a json string approximating the type. See [dflook/terraform-output](terraform-output) for details.
  This also affects the outputs of [dflook/terraform-apply](terraform-apply) and [dflook/terraform-remote-state](terraform-remote-state).

### Fixed
- File path in failing checks is now correct with respect to the repository, and can be clicked through to see the annotation in context.
  This affects the [dflook/terraform-fmt-check](terraform-fmt-check) and [dflook/terraform-validate](terraform-validate) actions.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-07-07

### Added
- The root-level outputs of a terraform configuration are now exposed directly
  by the [dflook/terraform-apply](terraform-apply) action, as if the
  [dflook/terraform-output](terraform-output) action has been run immediately after.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-07-06
